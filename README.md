## Addition

- The application has two main components: the frontend and the backend. The frontend, built with **React.js**, provides an intuitive user interface where customers can search for hotels based on various criteria such as location, dates, and room types. It also enables users to view hotel details, amenities, and prices before making a reservation.

- Upon selecting a hotel and filling out the necessary information, the backend, developed using **Node.js** with **Express** framework, handles the booking process. It interacts with a database to store and retrieve hotel information, user details, and reservation data. The backend also integrates with payment gateways to facilitate secure online transactions.

- Additionally, the project includes a management system that allows hotel administrators to handle various tasks efficiently. Through the management system, administrators can view and manage reservations, update hotel details, add or remove rooms, and generate reports on occupancy and revenue.

- The Hotel Booking and Management project utilizes modern web technologies to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for both customers and hotel administrators. It simplifies the hotel booking process, enhances efficiency in managing reservations, and provides valuable insights for hotel owners to make informed decisions.
